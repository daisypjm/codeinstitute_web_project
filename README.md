# Thyme Bandits

The time-saving kitchen tool for accessing all the recipes I waste time googling every week instead of just bookmarking.

# Stage 1
- Create basic structure with home page, and links to recipes.
- Consider the recipe taxonomy! How will I want to navigate my recipes or find obscure ones, once the site is populated?

# Stage 2
- Collect all the recipes I most commonly use, and add them to the site, each with its own page.
- Add my own notes, revisions, and handy tips.
- Include original sources and links - I am a curator, not a chef! These are not my recipes and I need to credit the original geniuses behind them!

# Stage 3
- Add some functionality to quickly add links to new recipes I find.
- This would be a page in the back end for me to store new recipes to add, a sort of backlog.

# Stage 4
- Explore methods to automatically extract ONLY the recipe card sections of online recipes, along with the source.
- At the moment this tool is only for me, so doesn't need any fancy key words or autobiopgraphical content from blog posts. Just juicy time saving recipes.

# Stage 5
- Keep adding, refining, and building out with new recipes or categories where I don't have a lot of content.
